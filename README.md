# LMC 2700 Project 5

Hey!!! So grab the Project5 folder, it has all my stuff in it.

# Current Features:  
  - drawing ability  
  - color selection  
  - pen size selection  
  - buttons: done (new frame), clear, and finish (to finish entire piece
  - frame count  
  - moving sidebar 
        -3 menu options: Templates, Add Your Own, and About (I figure for like our names and about the project)
        -note: no current functionality of these options
        
        

  
 # What needs to be done
 
  
  -ability to view last canvas element: Once we can save and store this should be fairly easy   
  -ability to view the entire flipbook in a series once all done
 
 
 # Extra Features (if time permits):  
  -add previous canvas as a transparent layer to make it easier for the user to add the next element in the flipbook  
  -add built-in shapes that can be applied (Again this will probably be achievable once we figure out how to store canvases)
